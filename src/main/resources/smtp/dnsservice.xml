<!-- If autodiscover is true, James will attempt to autodiscover the DNS servers configured on your underlying system.-->
<!-- Currently, this works if the OS has a unix-like /etc/resolv.conf,-->
<!-- or the system is Windows based with ipconfig or winipcfg.-->

<!-- If no DNS servers are found and you have not specified any below, 127.0.0.1 will be used-->
<!-- If you use autodiscover and add DNS servers manually a combination of all the dns servers will be used  -->
<!--  -->
<!-- Information includes a list of DNS Servers to be used by James.  These are -->
<!-- specified by the server elements, each of which is a child element of the -->
<!-- servers element.  Each server element is the IP address of a single DNS server. -->
<!-- The servers element can have multiple server children. -->
